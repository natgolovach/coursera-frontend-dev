                <div class="text">White sharks, known scientifically as Carcharodon carcharias, are apex predators of the ocean. With their iconic torpedo-shaped bodies and powerful jaws filled with serrated teeth, they instill both fear and fascination. These magnificent creatures are found in oceans across the globe, preferring temperate and coastal waters where they hunt seals, sea lions, and other marine mammals.</div>

                <div class="text">Despite their fierce reputation, white sharks are essential for maintaining the health of marine ecosystems. As apex predators, they help regulate the populations of their prey species, preventing them from overpopulating and disrupting the balance of the oceanic food web. Their role as top predators also indicates the overall health of the ecosystem they inhabit.</div>

                <div class="text">White sharks face numerous threats, including habitat loss, pollution, and overfishing. Despite international conservation efforts, they are still vulnerable due to their slow reproductive rates and long gestation periods. Conservationists continue to study and advocate for the protection of these magnificent creatures to ensure their survival and the health of our oceans for generations to come.</div>
